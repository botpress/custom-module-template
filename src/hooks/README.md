## Hooks

Every time the server is started, Hooks that you put in this folder will be copied in the `data/global/hooks/starter-module/HOOK_TYPE/` folder.
They will overwrite existing files only if they haven't been edited manually.

Check the documentation for more information about [Hooks](https://v12.botpress.com/building-chatbots/developers/hooks)
