2. Make your changes in the code. See [How do I do XYZ?](#how-do-i-do-xyz)
3. To rename the package, change the folder name, the name field in [src/backend/index.ts](src/backend/index.ts) and the name field in [src/backend/index.ts](src/backend/index.ts)

11. Start editing a chatbot. notice the flag icon for the custom module.
12. When you change your code, restart from from step 7.


## (Advanced) Where's Hot Reload?
Botpress doesn't currently support hot reload for custom module development. If you want to make changes and check them often, we recommend you clone the main repo and follow the instructions found [here](https://v12.botpress.com/building-chatbots/developers/custom-modules#local-development-tips). Changes will be reflected upon restarting the botpress server.

Generally speaking : 
1) Clone the main repo. ``git clone https://github.com/botpress/botpress.git``
2) run ``yarn && yarn build`` in the main repo path.
3) follow ["Module Templates"](https://v12.botpress.com/building-chatbots/developers/custom-modules#module-templates)
4) Follow ["Local Development Tips"](https://v12.botpress.com/building-chatbots/developers/custom-modules#local-development-tips)
5) Use the command ``yarn start`` to start the Botpress server.
6) To see changes, cancel the previous command, and use it again to restart the Botpress server and refresh your browser.

Pro tip : 
The bot making experience is smoother than the custom module building experience. If you can, make your changes in a Botpress Bot, then migrate the changes to your custom module code.
